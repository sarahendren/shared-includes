  <h2>About These Sites</h2>
  <p>This three-part web site documents the work of <a href="http://sarahendren.siteleaf.net">Sara Hendren</a>, tracks the research of the <a href="http://adaptationabilitygroup.siteleaf.net">Adaptation + Ability Group</a> at <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin College</a>, and houses the ongoing <a href="http://abler.siteleaf.net">Abler</a> archive. It’s good you’re here. Some bodies do some things, and others do others. Prosthetics, bodily capacity, expanded engineering and creative research, flexible adaptation, possible futures, interdependence, collaborative design, open augmentation, inclusive systems, productive uncertainty, and critical making—these things drive our work. You can see a comprehensive site map below. Or you can peruse some <a href="http://adaptationabilitygroup.siteleaf.net/projects/">lab projects</a>, take a look at <a href="http://abler.siteleaf.net/guides/">some guides to using the Abler archive</a>, or read more about and contact <a href="http://sarahendren.siteleaf.net">Sara Hendren</a>. We hope—we do try—to cultivate humility in the face of complexity. Please be in touch.</p>
